The code for generating the raw data in the article is located in the **notebooks**([https://huggingface.co/hkqiu/PolymerGenerationPretrainedModel](https://github.com/hkqiu/PolymerGenerationPretrainedModel/tree/main/notebooks)) folder. The PolyTAO pre-trained model has been open-sourced on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/hkqiu/PolymerGenerationPretrainedModel) and can be accessed and downloaded from that site.
